# wizard that always fails without a TTY (as in this build). Workers authenticate via
# DEVIN_OUTPOSTS_TOKEN instead, so that failure is harmless -- but it's still the exit
# code of the whole `curl | bash` pipeline. Chaining the executable check with `;` makes
# "the binary actually works" the real success signal instead, so a genuine install
# failure (bad download, missing binary, ...) still fails the build.
